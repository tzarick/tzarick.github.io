      <p>
        I'm a software engineer interested in building things from the ground up.
        Specifically, I have an interest for clean, maintainable software projects, open source software and hardware,
        full stack development, deep learning, ioT, embedded systems, audio technology, and any other compelling
        technology or idea (I'm easily compelled).
        I'm always interested in broadening my horizons and try to learn continuously by doing.

            ConcertBug is a live music search assistant. It's a web application that reads the user's music library and
            finds all relevant live shows according to the artists they listen to.
            It displays concerts geographically - it drops markers for all the user's concerts within a selected date
            range and mile radius from any point on the map that is clicked.
            So the user can select their location (or anywhere) and see each concert around them in which an artist they
            like is playing, along with details and a ticket link.
            <br /><br />
            This was an independent web app project I built as a way to fuel my passion for live music and discovering
            cool local (or not so local) shows in an all-in-one, filterable way.
            Especially medium to small gigs! Those long forgotten artists buried deep in a playlist that I would never
            seek out proactively, but if I knew they were playing at a bar in town I'd show up in a heartbeat.
            <br /><br />
            I rebuilt the application from scratch (throughout Fall 2020) in order to focus on clean, maintainable,
            object-oriented design and to put my Typescript knowledge to the test.

        </li>
        <div class="projDescription" id="cbusZoo">
          <p>
            This was a multi-disciplinary project that started as a request from the keepers in the Heart of Africa
            region at the Columbus Zoo & Aquarium. They wanted a way to cognitively engage the giraffes to reduce the
            occurance of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypy_(non-human)" style="color:rgb(33, 220, 245);"
              target="_blank">steroetypic behaviors</a> they were observing.
            <br /><br />
            A team of myself and two others (specializing in Zoology and Biological Engineering)
            designed, prototyped, implemented, and studied the effects of a custom-built "<a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_enrichment" style="color:rgb(33, 220, 245);"
              target="_blank">enrichment</a> box" which contains physical interactability, along with motion detecting
            functionalities. The main function of the device was to give the
            giraffe control over their environment by allowing them to trigger either a food dispense or a music change
            in the giraffe barn (depending on mode) via tongue manipulation.
            <br /><br />
            I led the electronics and software design and implementation for the project. This project centered around a
            wifi-enabled microcontroller. Among my main tasks were: embedded software architecture
            that handles basic box functionality and wireless control signals, peripheral analog circuitry design to
            support our external devices and power input, and interfacing with external APIs.
            <br /><br />
            After the project was in flight, we were able to secure funding from The Ohio State University Office of
            Undergraduate Research and began a formal research project centered around the device and behavioral
            observation.
            <br /><br />
            We presented our findings at the 2019 International <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffidae"

            This started as a gift idea for members of my family. It's a box that can't be opened until it is taken to
            some specific geographic coordinates on the globe. It's kind of like reverse <a

              target="_blank">geocaching</a>.
            This is what I "wrapped" my gifts with that I gave to my family for Xmas 2019. Although seemingly cruel at
            first, I like to think of it more as the gift of adventure rather than the curse of a tease so close you can
            smell it...
            <br /><br />
            This project consists of a small aluminum box with a 3 digit lock combination on the front. I modified this
            by installing peripherals onto the box including a small LCD display, push button, piezo buzzer, power
            switch, and outfitted it with a GPS module.
            I gave the box a brain (Arduino Pro Mini), a checkpoint, and a final destination (the checkpoint is a secret
            to the box recipient, they just see a direction and distance).
            <br /><br />
            The LCD display shows 1) heading in degrees, and 2) distance in miles to go.
            At the checkpoints there was a physical clue in real life hinting how to interact with the box to unlock the
            real destination (the furthest distance I set a box's final dst away from the xmas morning spot was ~2000
            miles but the checkpoints were all in town :0).
            The final checkpoint reveals the combination on-screen.

            This project was born out of the frustration caused by trying to even up friends after a long weekend where
            we all spent varying amounts of money.
            This seemingly simple task is always slightly more difficult than I imagine, and mental math is often
            futile. Once you get 4 or more people involved,
            trying to determine who pays who what in order for everyone to have spent the same amount of money quickly
            requires pen and paper.
            <br /><br />
            Pay Friends Back is the simple solution. The user inputs each friend name and how much they spent and PFB
            displays exactly how much each person should pay, and
            who each person should pay in order for everyone to have spent an equal amount.
            <br /><br />
            This project was built with Go on the backend and uses a no-framework pure javascript frontend to keep

            feedback. This custom pedal was used frequently with my own and my roommates' instruments.
